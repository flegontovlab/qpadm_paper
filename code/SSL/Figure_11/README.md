# Figure 11

Data for Figure 11 were obtained from preprints posted on the bioRxiv preprint server. These data sets can be obtained from the following links:

- https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2024/03/19/2024.03.15.585102/DC1/embed/media-1.xlsx?download=true (Speidel _et al._ 2024)
- https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.01.560332v2.supplementary-material (Zeng _et al._ 2023)

All qpAdm results from the published spreadsheets were aggregated and slightly reformatted before processing.

The results of Speidel _et al._ (2024) are stratified by target group name, model label (model), proxy source name (source), and model complexity (n_sources).

The results of Zeng _et al._ (2023) are stratified by data file number (data_file), suppl. table number within the files (table), qpAdm "tranche" (see Zeng _et al._ 2023), target group name, model label (model), proxy source name (source), and model complexity (n_sources).
