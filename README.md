Principal software packages used in this study are:

- slendr v. 0.7.2.9000 (Petr et al. 2023; https://github.com/bodkan/slendr),
- msprime v. 1.1.1 and v. 1.2.0 (Baumdicker et al. 2022; https://github.com/tskit-dev/msprime), and
- ADMIXTOOLS 2 (Maier et al. 2023; https://github.com/uqrmaie1/admixtools).

Other code for generating the simulated genetic data, running qpAdm protocols, and visualization is available in this repository (extensive comments are included within the R scripts). Input data for all the scripts is available in the respective folders here, and larger input files (sets of qpAdm results on simulated data) are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14966948.
